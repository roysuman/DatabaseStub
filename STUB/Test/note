MOST IMP: make and review the design..... change the name to STUB.. not TCP STUB...


1. there won't be any separate struture folder. all stryct must be defined inside corresponding .hpp.. if some structs are handled by lots of .cpp then make a folder called common andstore the struct under that. 
2. no global variable..
3. all function must returns only bool value// success &/ failure
4. global varibale for las error...
5. most print under ifdef debug that defination must be read from a separate file, from where user can set up during run time
6. one layer of database.
7. complete variable length part for database and do 1st release.
8. all binary will be in a releasefolder. under STUB, and GUI folder for QT codes
9. a global data structure for holding all global veriable
10. pacp captured date will be written in  a file , and processing will start once capturing completed.
12. a structure for holding curret project all information, and that will be poSTUB_INTed to the global struct
13. datastruct pass as a void, .. if some method is unique( ike file write, rcv data as a STUB_CHAR array rather than struct ).
14. maSTUB_INTain three logs, DEBUG LOG , STDOUT , STDCERR 
15. tol me work on tcp as well as udp packets, later on usb driver also,, 
16. separate the codes as much as possible.. make less dependent.
17. change dblayer methods as static


-----------------------------------------------------MODULES-----------------------------------------------------
1. packet capture module-> it will capture the packets from netCrd( for now) later it may be drivers as well.
			  capture and write packets into file..... ( during capturing check the desired port for filtering )
2. Process Packet-> Once packets capturing done , read the packets from file dissect it and stor it in DB. 
			if already a dump file available then processing can start dirrectly by the help of tcp dump file.
3.generate new packets-> most imp part, generate similar query and response or update the existig query or delete existing query.
			after generating the query update the query dissect values into database with binary response as well. 
4 . Dummy server-> dummy server that will act as a real server with thehelp of created dummy data.

------------------------------------------------------WORK PROG------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO-> Optimize the logic for create and open project.. separate from GUI design keep a console base design as well....
    -> one datastructure ( global ) that will keep he curent project information-- like project name..bla bla... database poSTUB_INTer...
    --database name..( that is project name ) tables names are some projectName+suffix
. skip STUB_INTerface (packet capture module now).. just use some tcp dump file, as a captured file....
