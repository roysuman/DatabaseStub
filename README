[TO get idea about the project ... the name of the project will be change once it's ready to launch.]
This is my dream project. The main idea of this project is to virtualize network packets.

It's not clear enough?

For example, suppose your application has a MySQL database. Now when ever you try to access your application it needs access to a database .
Consider following conditions:
 1. Suppose a tester want's to test your application.
 2. Developer wants to change some code.
 3. Application is dependent on some third party DB.
 
 For all the above scenarios a database connection need to be established.

 To reduce these dependencies I am developing this tool.

How it works?

 You need an existing environment, where application has full access to DB. Using pcap library capture network level packets, of all possible queries fetched by application. Now this packet's are getting used as a training data for this tool.
  
Using those captured-packet dump Databse-STUB will be able to replace database.

  Database-STUB dissect network packets in a minimal format and store the dissected value into a sqlite3 database. It has an extra feature, response of a query can be modified and even a new query can be added by using the captured training data.

Initially it was an idea, did some poc to confirm the possibility of this project. At present I am writing a fresh copy of this project( see redesign repo), with proper architecture and clean code.
